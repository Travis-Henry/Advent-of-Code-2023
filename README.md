## Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Welcome to my solutions to the 2023 Advent of Code!

## Folder Structure

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
